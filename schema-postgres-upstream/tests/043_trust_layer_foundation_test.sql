-- 043_trust_layer_foundation_test.sql
-- ------------------------------------------------------------
-- Tests for 043_trust_layer_foundation.sql. Four things are worth testing
-- here and nothing else is:
--
--   1. The handle format rule. A handle becomes a hostname under a wildcard
--      DNS record, so a value the rule lets through is a value that resolves
--      on the public internet. Uppercase, a leading or trailing hyphen, or a
--      `xn--` prefix each produce a hostname that is either invalid or a
--      Unicode lookalike, and none may reach the column.
--
--   2. The claim registry. The reason it exists is that a profile row is
--      deleted with its authentication account, and availability decided from
--      profiles alone would hand a deleted account's hostname — and its Safe
--      Browsing reputation — to whoever signs up next. So: reserved names are
--      unclaimable, a second account cannot take a live name, an allocated
--      name cannot change, and deleting the profile does not free it.
--
--   3. host_handle immutability and ownership. The router matches the request's
--      hostname against this column. A customer who could write it freely
--      could have their document served on `microsoft.htmlradar.page`, which
--      is exactly the reputation-poisoning per-share hostnames were introduced
--      to prevent (design property P10). `authenticated` still holds a
--      table-level UPDATE grant on document_shares, so this is reachable
--      through PostgREST and the trigger is the only thing in the way.
--
--   4. The view's shape and its grants. It carries every customer's handle and
--      every document's R2 storage key. Supabase's default privileges hand new
--      objects in `public` to anon and authenticated and PostgREST publishes
--      every view in `public`, so "did the REVOKE actually take" is the single
--      most consequential assertion in this file.
--
-- WHAT IS NOT TESTED HERE: allocation. Deriving a handle from an account,
-- shortening it on collision and falling back to a generated name is
-- application code in a later lane; this migration deliberately allocates
-- nothing. The concurrent-allocation property IS covered, in section B, at the
-- level this migration owns it: the primary key on handle_registry, which is
-- what makes two simultaneous claims resolve to one winner.
--
-- RUN THIS AGAINST A SCRATCH DATABASE ONLY. It creates auth.users, profiles,
-- documents, shares and handle_registry rows. Everything sits inside one
-- transaction that ROLLBACKs at the end, so nothing is left behind — but a
-- rollback does not undo a mistake made against production, so point psql at
-- a scratch copy.
--
--   psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -f schema/001_init.sql   (…then 002, 003, 008,
--                                                     015, 027, 032, 033, 043,
--                                                     052)
--   psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -f schema/tests/043_trust_layer_foundation_test.sql
--
-- 052 IS PART OF THE RUN, not an optional extra. It replaces this migration's
-- share-host trigger with one that also covers custom domains, freezes
-- host_handle in the null direction too, and adds four columns to
-- share_lookup. Sections C and D below assert the behaviour AFTER that
-- replacement, because that is the behaviour production has.
--
-- A throwaway Postgres in Docker is the scratch database this was written
-- against, exactly as 034's, 035's and 037's test files document:
--
--   docker run -d --name hr-schema-test -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres \
--     -p 55432:5432 postgres:15
--   export PGPASSWORD=postgres PGHOST=localhost PGPORT=55432 PGUSER=postgres
--   …then the auth-schema and role setup 034's header lists, then the schema
--   files, then this.
--
-- Output is one NOTICE per test. Any failure raises and aborts the run.
