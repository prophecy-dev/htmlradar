-- 034_api_keys_test.sql
-- ------------------------------------------------------------
-- Tests for 034_api_keys.sql. Two things are worth testing here and nothing
-- else is:
--
--   1. api_keys RLS. A key is a bearer credential for someone's whole
--      account, so "can customer A read, write or revoke customer B's key
--      rows through PostgREST?" is the only question that matters about this
--      table. These tests therefore run as the `authenticated` role with a
--      jwt sub set, exactly as a request through PostgREST does — running
--      them as the superuser would bypass RLS and prove nothing.
--
--   2. create_share_as. It exists so an API request can create a link with no
--      Supabase session. The risk is that it becomes a second, weaker path
--      into document_shares. So: the free-tier cap must still fire through
--      it, the chosen-address rules must still apply through it, the share
--      must end up owned by p_user_id, and no customer-reachable role may
--      execute it.
--
-- RUN THIS AGAINST A SCRATCH DATABASE ONLY. It creates auth.users rows,
-- profiles, documents, shares and keys. Everything sits inside one
-- transaction that ROLLBACKs at the end, so nothing is left behind — but a
-- rollback does not undo a mistake made against production, so point psql at
-- a scratch copy.
--
--   psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -f schema/001_init.sql   (…then 002, 003, 008,
--                                                     027, 033, 034, and 052,
--                                                     which re-signs
--                                                     create_share_as)
--   psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -f schema/tests/034_api_keys_test.sql
--
-- A throwaway Postgres in Docker is the scratch database this was written
-- against, and is the easiest one to get:
--
--   docker run -d --name hr-schema-test -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres \
--     -p 55432:5432 postgres:15
--   export PGPASSWORD=postgres PGHOST=localhost PGPORT=55432 PGUSER=postgres
--   psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -c 'create extension if not exists pgcrypto'
--   …then the role setup below, then the schema files, then this file.
--
-- On a scratch database that is not a real Supabase project, the roles and
-- table grants Supabase provides have to exist first, or the RLS tests below

--   create role service_role nologin bypassrls;
--   grant usage on schema public to anon, authenticated, service_role;
--   grant all on all tables in schema public to anon, authenticated, service_role;
--   alter default privileges in schema public
--     grant all on tables to anon, authenticated, service_role;
