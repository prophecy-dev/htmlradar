-- 047_radar_drafts_test.sql
-- ------------------------------------------------------------
-- Tests for 047_radar_drafts.sql — the invariants that belong to the database
-- rather than to the worker.
--
--   A. The status check refuses anything outside the seven states. The whole
--      one-tap flow is a state machine over this column; a typo'd status would
--      leave a draft no handler ever picks up again.
--   B. `posted` and `skipped` are terminal, enforced by a trigger. This is the
--      race Sol's review found: Skip and edit rewrote status unconditionally,
--      so a Skip arriving mid-post could unclaim a draft that Reddit was
--      already being asked about. Everything else stays mutable, because
--      `failed` and `reconcile` are explicitly retryable and filling in a
--      permalink on a posted row is not a status change.
--   C. The reservation ledger: one row per thread, append-only, with the
--      owning draft allowed to retry and nobody else allowed in. This is what
--      replaced the partial unique index on status='posted', which the failure
--      path RELEASED — so a comment Reddit accepted but never acknowledged
--      left the thread open to be commented on a second time.
--   D. Two nonces are never alike. A nonce is a bearer credential for speaking
--      as the founder; two rows sharing one would make a tap ambiguous.
--   E. Nothing customer-facing can read or write either table, or call the
--      function that writes.
--
-- WHAT IS NOT TESTED HERE: concurrency. A psql file inside one transaction has
-- exactly one session, and the cap's atomicity is a claim about several. That
-- is 047_radar_drafts_concurrency_test.sh, which launches ten simultaneous
-- psql processes against the same throwaway database; run both. The Reddit and
-- Telegram halves live in packages/monitor/tests/reddit-onetap.test.ts.
--
-- RUN THIS AGAINST A SCRATCH DATABASE ONLY. Everything sits inside one
-- transaction that ROLLBACKs at the end, so nothing is left behind — but a
-- rollback does not undo a mistake made against production, so point psql at
-- a scratch copy.

--   psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -c "create role anon; create role authenticated;
--                               create role service_role bypassrls;

--   psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -f schema/047_radar_drafts.sql
--   psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -f schema/tests/047_radar_drafts_test.sql
--
-- 047 stands alone: it creates its own tables and depends on no earlier file,
-- so unlike 037's test this one does not need the 001/002/003 stack first. The
-- default-privileges lines above are not decoration: Supabase grants the
-- service role every new public table and function that way, and a stock
-- Postgres without them would fail section E for a reason that does not exist
-- on the real database.
--
-- Output is one NOTICE per test. Any failure raises and aborts the run.
