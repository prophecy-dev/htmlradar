// Regenerates public/llms-full.txt from the LIVE site's own HTML.
//
// Why generated rather than written: llms-full.txt is a copy of text that
// already exists on the pages. A hand-maintained copy drifts, and a file
// that states last month's price is worse than no file at all. This reads
// the pages, so it can only ever be as wrong as the site is.
//
//   pnpm gen:llms                      # reads https://htmlradar.com
//   pnpm gen:llms http://localhost:3000
//
// Run it AFTER a deploy, then commit the result. It is deliberately not a
// build step: a build that reaches out to the network is a build that fails
// when the network does.
//
// Worth knowing before you spend time here: the evidence that anything reads
// this file is thin. Ahrefs' 137,000-domain server-log study found 97% of
// published llms.txt files got zero requests, and Google's AI optimization
// guide says Search ignores it. The narrow case that still argues for it is
// developer tooling (Cursor, Copilot) fetching docs, which is our audience.
// See docs/workstreams/seo-and-indexing/GEO-2026-09-04.md before extending.
