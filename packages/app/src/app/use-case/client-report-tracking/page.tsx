// /use-case/client-report-tracking — the answer page for the recurring
// client report: an agency, consultancy or analyst sends the same report
// every month and never learns whether it was read.
//
// Why this page and not another: the buyer question "did the client read
// the report" appears in three independent Reddit threads inside a
// fortnight (r/PPC 1vwyagd, r/AskMarketing 1vz0gl8 and 1vwvtp2, logged in
// MONDAY-CHECK-2026-08-31.md) and Google and Bing autocomplete both return
// "how to share html report" / "how to share an html document". It is the
// one intent bucket A of ICP-AND-CHANNEL-STRATEGY-2026-09-02.md names —
// firms that send client-facing HTML repeatedly — that no page owned.
//
// One intent per page, per the 31 Aug SEO decision. /use-case/proposal-tracking
// owns the one-off proposal, /use-case/pitch-deck-tracking the raise,
// /use-case/track-html-deck any HTML document, /tools/html-to-link the
// transactional "convert this file now". This page owns the recurring
// report and nothing else.

            How do I share an HTML report with clients?
          </h1>
          <DirectAnswer updated="September 2026">
            Send an HTML report to a client as a private link for each client rather than as an
            attachment. HTMLRadar hosts the file, e-mails you the first time a client opens it — at
            the e-mail gate, or after five seconds on an ungated link — and shows which sections
            they read. Free for two tracked links, then $15 a month.
          </DirectAnswer>
          <p className="mt-6 max-w-2xl text-[16px] leading-relaxed text-ink-soft">
            An HTML report sent as an attachment is a file that may not open, may not render, and
            tells you nothing once it has gone. Sharing it as a link keeps the page a page — charts,
            layout and links all still working — and turns &ldquo;did they read it?&rdquo; into a
            question with an answer.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 max-w-2xl text-[16px] leading-relaxed text-ink-soft">
            You send the monthly report on the first. By the tenth nobody has replied, and on the
            call someone asks a question the report answered in its second section. An attachment
            gives you nothing to go on, so the honest answer to &ldquo;did they read it?&rdquo; is
            that you have never once known.

            <p className="mt-4 text-[16px] leading-relaxed text-ink-soft">
              Upload the report once, then create a separate link for each client. Every link can
              ask for an e-mail before it opens, carry a password, or expire on a date you set. When
              the engagement ends, revoke the link and the report goes dark — it stops being served,
              not merely hidden. Next month you replace the file rather than send a new link, so
              each client keeps one address all year and you keep one running record of their
              reading. The guide on{' '}

              On an ungated link, nothing is recorded until the visit has lasted five seconds, which
              drops quick bounces and most link previews. On a gated link the session starts when
              the client submits their e-mail. Either way you get one e-mail, on the first open,
              carrying the report title and whatever the gate knows about the reader, stamped in
              your own timezone. Opens it recognises as repeats stay silent; you read those off the
              dashboard.

              A section only accumulates time once it has been at least half on screen for a

              left tells you which half of the report is doing the work: nearly three minutes on
              what changed, nine seconds on the method notes. That is what to lead with next month,
              and what to stop writing.
