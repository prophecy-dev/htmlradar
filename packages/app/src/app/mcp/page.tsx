const FAQ = [
  {
    q: 'What does the HTMLRadar MCP server do?',
    a: 'It lets your agent publish an HTML document as a tracked link, make more links for a document it has already published, list what you have sent, read back who opened a link and which sections held them, switch a link off, and replace a document while every link you have already sent keeps working. There are two routes to it: a custom connector you add to Claude Desktop or claude.ai by pasting one web address, and a stdio npm package for Claude Code, Cursor, Codex CLI and any other MCP client.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How is this different from other publish-from-an-agent MCP servers?',
    a: 'Most of them stop at returning a URL. HTMLRadar keeps the other half of the loop: the agent can ask, the next day, whether the recipient read what you sent and which sections they spent time on. That question is the reason the server exists.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Do I need an API key?',
    a: 'For the package, yes. Sign in at htmlradar.com, open Settings, and create a key under API keys. Pass it to the server as the HTMLRADAR_API_KEY environment variable rather than as a literal command-line argument, so it stays out of your shell history. The server reads nothing else and sends no telemetry. If you add HTMLRadar to Claude Desktop or claude.ai as a custom connector instead, there is no key to make: you sign in when Claude first uses a tool and the key is minted for that connection.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What does the recipient see?',
    a: 'The HTML you supplied, behind an email prompt unless you turn the gate off. Your source file stays unchanged; the page HTMLRadar serves adds the tracker script, and on a free link a small Powered by HTMLRadar badge. They never see the tracking data, the dashboard, or anyone else who opened the link. HTMLRadar stores no raw IP address, no keystrokes, no mouse positions and no session replay.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What happens when the free links run out?',
    a: 'The free tier covers two tracked links. After that the share_html tool returns an upgrade message instead of a link, and the agent is instructed to relay it to you rather than retry. Pro is $15 a month or $150 a year for unlimited links.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I point it at my own instance?',
    a: 'Yes. HTMLRadar is AGPL-3.0 end to end. Set HTMLRADAR_API_URL to your own deployment and the server talks to that instead of htmlradar.com.',

            HTMLRadar is an open-source tool for sharing an HTML deck, brief, or proposal as a
            tracked link, and seeing who opened it, which sections they read, and for how long. The
            MCP server is how an agent does that without you leaving the conversation.

            Plenty of MCP servers will put a file on the internet and hand back a URL. That is the
            easy half. The half that matters is the next morning, when you want to know whether the
            person you sent it to actually read it. That is the half this one keeps.
