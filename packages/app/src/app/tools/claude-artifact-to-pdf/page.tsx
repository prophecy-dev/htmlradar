// Free tool page: HTML in, PDF out. Sol's messaging review, 31 Aug 2026: the
// tool direction is fine as a funnel, but the copy must not read as though PDF
// is where a deck ends up. The framing is that the PDF is the frozen copy you
// hand over when someone insists, and the HTML you already have is the version
// that can be read back — so every closing block routes to the tracked link.
//
// HTML in, PDF out. No sign-in, and the file itself is never
// uploaded to HTMLRadar — the page renders it in a sandboxed iframe and hands
// that iframe to the browser's own print dialog. The sandbox blocks scripts,
// forms and navigation; it does not stop the browser fetching images, fonts or
// stylesheets the HTML points at, so the copy must never promise that nothing
// leaves the machine.

            Save or export the artifact as an HTML file, drop it here, and press Save as PDF. Your
            browser&rsquo;s own print dialog writes the PDF, and the file itself is never uploaded
            to HTMLRadar. Scripts, forms and navigation are blocked in the preview, so interactive
            artifacts print as their static layout. The PDF is a frozen copy; the HTML stays the
            version you can send as a tracked link.

              You get the page exactly as your browser lays it out for print. Scripts, forms and
              navigation are blocked in the preview, so an artifact that builds part of itself after
              loading, or that reveals content on a click, prints as its static layout. Long pages
              break across print pages the way the browser decides.

              The file itself is never uploaded to HTMLRadar. Your browser reads it, previews it,

              One thing worth knowing: if the HTML references images, fonts or stylesheets on other
              websites, your browser fetches those to render the preview, exactly as it would on any
              web page. Scripts, forms and navigation are blocked in the preview.
