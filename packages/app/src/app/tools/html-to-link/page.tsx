// Free tool page: drop an HTML file, preview it, sign in, get a tracked link.
// The tool sits above the fold because the search intent behind
// "html file to link converter online free" is to do the thing, not read
// about it. The copy below exists for the same reason every other marketing
// page has copy: so the page can rank and be cited.
//
// Sol's messaging review, 31 Aug 2026: four pages describe this same upload
// workflow, so each opening has to claim a different job. This one owns the
// transactional intent — the file is already on disk, the link is wanted now,
// and the browser-side preview is what only the tool pages offer.
// /use-case/track-html-deck owns the buyer story for a deck you already
// built, and /for/claude-artifacts owns the keep-revising workflow.

          <DirectAnswer updated="August 2026">
            To share an HTML file as a link, drop it on this page. Nothing is uploaded while you
            look: your own browser renders the preview, and the file reaches HTMLRadar only once you
            sign in. The link you get back reports who opened it, which sections they read, and for
            how long. Free for two tracked links, then $15 a month. Open source.

                Drop the .html or .htm file above. Your browser renders the preview, so you can

            <p className="mt-4 text-[16px] leading-relaxed text-ink-soft">
              A plain URL tells you nothing about the reader. A tracked link tells you who opened
              it, which sections they read, and how long they spent on each one. You can give each
              recipient their own link, so you know which of them read the pricing section and which
              stopped at the first page.

            <p className="mt-4 text-[16px] leading-relaxed text-ink-soft">
              Every link can carry an optional email gate, a password, and an expiry date. Revoke it
              and the link stops working.

            </h2>
            <p className="mt-4 text-[16px] leading-relaxed text-ink-soft">
              You can. Dropbox, S3, GitHub Pages, or your own server will all serve an HTML file at
              a URL, and if all you need is a public page, host it there. HTMLRadar answers a
              different question: whether the person you sent it to actually read it, which sections
              they read, and for how long. Each recipient gets their own link, so the answer is per
              person.

            <p className="mt-4 text-[16px] leading-relaxed text-ink-soft">
              Already hosting the page yourself? You can paste that URL into HTMLRadar instead of
              uploading a file, and track the page where it lives.
