// Free tool page: the same staging tool as /tools/html-to-link, framed for
// people who already have the exported HTML file and want the link right
// now — a transactional intent. /for/claude-artifacts owns the "how do I
// work with Claude artifacts" guide intent, so this opening stays short and
// verb-first rather than duplicating that framing. Deliberately says nothing
// about Claude's interface beyond saving or exporting the artifact as an
// HTML file.

            <p className="mt-4 text-[16px] leading-relaxed text-ink-soft">
              Sending an artifact usually ends the conversation: it either got read or it did not,
              and you never find out which. A tracked link reports who opened it, which sections
              they read, and how long they spent on each. Give each person their own link and the
              answer is per-person rather than a single view count.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 text-[16px] leading-relaxed text-ink-soft">
              Any link can require an email address before it opens, sit behind a password, or
              expire on a date you choose.

          <section className="mt-12">

              Why not just send the artifact?
            </h2>
            <p className="mt-4 text-[16px] leading-relaxed text-ink-soft">
              If the recipient is happy opening it wherever it already lives, send it that way.
              Sending a tracked link instead is worth it when the document is a pitch, a proposal,
              or a brief and the reading matters as much as the sending — and when you want to be
              able to close access afterwards.
