// /for/claude-artifacts is the workflow guide: how a Claude user fits
// tracked sharing into ongoing work with artifacts, from export through
// updating the same link later. /tools/claude-artifact-to-link owns the
// transactional "I have the file, give me a link now" intent, so this
// opening stays on the workflow rather than repeating that promise. Claude
// artifacts can be several formats, so this page must not imply every
// artifact can be uploaded as a standalone document.

            The workflow for tracking a Claude artifact you keep revising.

          <DirectAnswer updated="September 2026">
            When Claude writes a document for someone else, HTMLRadar turns it into a tracked link
            and reports back who opened it and which parts held them. Ask Claude to publish the
            artifact and it does that in the conversation; or export it and upload it yourself.
            Either way, replacing the file keeps the link you already sent. Free for two links.
