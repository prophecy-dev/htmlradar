    q: 'Does Claude Code offer this on its own?',

  {
    q: 'Can Claude tell me who read the deck?',
    a: 'Yes. Ask whether the link has been opened and Claude calls get_share_activity, which reports the viewer, when they first opened it, how long they actively read, how far they scrolled, and which sections took the most time.',

  {
    q: 'Does Claude see the reading data of everyone I have shared with?',

            When Claude Code writes a document for someone else — a deck, proposal or report —
            HTMLRadar turns it into a tracked link and reports back who opened it and which parts
            held them. Install the plugin, generate as usual, and the whole loop stays in the
            terminal. Free for two links, then $15 a month.

          <p className="mt-6 max-w-2xl text-[16px] leading-relaxed text-ink-soft">
            Claude Code is very good at producing a finished HTML document — a board update, a
            client proposal, a project brief with charts in it. The awkward part has always been
            what happens next. You copy the file somewhere, attach it to an email, and then it goes
            quiet. From here Claude can also send the same document to more people one link at a
            time, switch a link off, and rewrite the document behind links that have already gone
            out.
