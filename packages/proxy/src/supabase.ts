/**
 * The one read a recipient request makes.
 *
 * Reads `share_lookup` (schema/043), not `document_shares`. Two reasons, both
 * from the trust layer's design:
 *
 * The stored hostname has to be known BEFORE the gate cookies are checked,
 * because "a handle host that does not match this share's stored hostname is
 * not found" must answer before anything else does. A second call for it would
 * be a second round trip on the recipient's critical path.
 *
 * And the owner's tier comes back in the same row, which is why getProfileTier
 * is gone: this is now one database call where the document route made two.
 *
 * IT IS NOW A FUNCTION, NOT THE VIEW, AND THAT IS A SAFETY INTERLOCK.
 *
 * The application can reach production before this worker does, and a rollback
 * puts an older worker back in front of the same database. Either way a link
 * with `verify_email` set would be served by a worker that does not know the
 * flag exists, and it would open with no code — the deploy order was the only
 * thing standing between a customer and that (Astra, finding 3).
 *
 * So the database refuses instead of trusting the order. `share_lookup`, the
 * view every previous worker selects from, no longer contains verified shares
 * at all, so an old or rolled-back worker simply finds no row and answers its
 * standard not-found: unavailable, never open. This worker calls
 * `share_lookup_for` and DECLARES that it enforces verification, which is the
 * only way those rows are returned.
 *
 * The declaration is a promise this code keeps a few lines below, in the gate
 * that reads `share.verify_email`. It is not a security boundary against an
 * attacker — anyone holding the service-role key could pass true — it is an
 * interlock against ourselves, which is what the finding was about.
 *
 * Still one call on the recipient's critical path, and still the private
 * `share_lookup_all` underneath: security definer, granted to the service role
 * alone, exposing no password hash.
