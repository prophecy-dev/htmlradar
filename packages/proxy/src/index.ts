// Worker entry.
//
// HOSTS. Recipient documents are served from their own registrable domain,
// `SHARE_HOST` (htmlradar.page in production). A customer's HTML therefore
// never shares an origin with the application's session cookies, and a
// phishing page pushed through us cannot wear the primary domain's
// certificate or its reputation with the blocklists.
//
// `LEGACY_HOSTS` (htmlradar.com in production) is where every link sent
// before the move points. Those links keep working — see the legacy-host block
// at the top of handleRequest.
//
// Routes (on SHARE_HOST, and on a legacy host for POST only):
//   GET  /r/{slug}            serves the document, gates as needed
//   POST /r/{slug}/auth       password submission
//   POST /r/{slug}/email      email submission for allow-list shares
//   GET  /r/{slug}/report     the recipient's abuse report form
//   POST /r/{slug}/report     the report itself
//   GET  /r/{slug}/frame      the document, inside the trust wrapper's frame
//   GET  /r/{slug}/print      the document unframed, behind a signed grant
//   GET  /r/{slug}/m/{att_id} downloads a supporting-material attachment
//   GET  /r/_doc/{doc_id}     sender-side raw-doc preview (HMAC-gated)
//   GET  /v1/tracker.js       the tracker, first-party to the document
//   GET  /robots.txt          Disallow: / — no host this worker serves is a website
//   GET  /.well-known/htmlradar-domain-check
//                             which claim a hostname belongs to, and the only
//                             thing a claimed-but-not-live hostname answers
//
// CUSTOMERS' OWN DOMAINS (schema/052). A Pro customer can point their own
// subdomain at us, and a share issued on it stores `custom_domain_id`. Such a
// share is served on that exact hostname and on no other — not on the apex,
// which does not redirect to it either. The hostname's claim is read fresh on
// every request; nothing about a customer's domain is cached.
//
// THE TRUST WRAPPER. With TRUST_WRAPPER off — its shipped state — /r/{slug}
// answers exactly as it always has and /frame and /print are not-found. Turned
// on for a slug, /r/{slug} instead returns HTMLRadar's own thin page (see
// wrapper.ts) with the document in a frame above a strip the sender cannot
// remove, cover or intercept. The design is
// docs/workstreams/content-domain/TRUST-LAYER-DESIGN-2026-08-31.md.
//
// WHICH HOST SERVES WHAT. Every share carries a stored hostname, `host_handle`
// (schema/043), and routing follows THAT value rather than the owner's current
// handle, so no link that has already been sent ever moves. See resolveHost
// and enforceStoredHost below for the design's five rules; the check runs on
// every route carrying a share identifier, not only the document route.
//
// Anything else on SHARE_HOST is a 404, and every response carries
// X-Robots-Tag: noindex (see withNoIndex).
//
// The share route also carries the recipient's own switch for read tracking:
//   GET  /r/{slug}?optout=1|0 asks the question and mints a token
//   POST /r/{slug}            with `optout` + `token` writes the cookie
// See handleOptOutSubmit below for why the GET must not write.
//
// Gate order: password → allow-list email → content. Each gate issues an
// HMAC-signed cookie on success (see auth.ts); subsequent requests with the
// cookie skip the gate. The document body is only ever streamed when all
// applicable gates have passed.

 *      links already sent, and they work forever — no redirect, no repeated
 *      gate. Every share that exists today is one of these.
 *   2. Apex request, share stores a hostname: permanent redirect to it. Those
 *      links were only ever printed in handle form, so no session is
 *      disturbed. A method that carries a body redirects with 308, never 301,
 *      which would turn a gate submission into a GET and drop what was typed.
 *      This rule alone sits behind TRUST_HANDLES — the same single setting
 *      that lets the application print handle links — so a rollback stops the
 *      redirects and the new links together. Off, such a share is simply
 *      served in place on the apex.
 *   3. A handle host that does not match the share's stored hostname: not
 *      found, and identically so. Without this an abuser could have their own
 *      document served on a rival's host, or on microsoft.htmlradar.page, and
 *      poison a name they do not own.
 *   4. A share issued on a customer's own domain is served on that exact
 *      hostname and NOWHERE else — not on the apex, not on a handle host, not
 *      on another customer's domain. No redirect from the apex either: rule 2
 *      moves a handle link because the apex form of it was never printed, but
 *      a redirect from the apex to a customer's domain would let anybody turn
 *      an htmlradar.page address into an address that wears the customer's
 *      name. The apex simply does not have it.
 *   5. A customer's domain serves only the shares that stored it. Everything
 *      else — an apex share, a handle share, another customer's share — is the
