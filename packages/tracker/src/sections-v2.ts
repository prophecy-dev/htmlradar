// sections-v2.ts — range-based section dwell tracker.
//
// A section is a RANGE of the document, not one element: for a heading, the
// heading plus everything under it up to the next heading of the same or
// higher level. Its geometry is the union of its members' boxes, read fresh
// each sample; no wrapper is ever inserted into the customer's document.
//
// Each sample credits exactly one section — the one covering most of the
// window — gated by the IAB Viewable Impression Standard (≥50% coverage of
// the range, or of the window once the range is the taller of the two, for
// ≥1s continuously before credit qualifies). Two earlier shapes are gone and
// should not come back: measuring a heading's own 40 pixels, which stopped
// counting the moment the reader scrolled past the heading into the section
// it names; and splitting each sample across every visible section, which
// billed a section and its own subsection for the same second.
//
// Public contract is identical to sections-legacy.ts (Session imports
// `SectionTracker` and calls start/stop/pause/resume/snapshot only) so
// the swap in session.ts is a one-line import change.
