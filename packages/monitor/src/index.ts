// htmlradar-monitor — minimal cron worker that pages the founder when
// prod looks broken. Runs every 5 min. Stupid simple by design.
//
// Four checks:
//   1. notifications_log has any status='failed' rows in the last 30
//      min. This catches the migration-013 class of bug where a
//      backend regression silently drops customer-facing emails.
//   2. The four critical user-facing routes (/, /pricing, /docs,
//      /sign-in) return HTTP 200, and the content domain that serves
//      recipient documents answers on both a share path and
//      robots.txt. Retried before paging so a transient edge blip
//      doesn't. Catches deploy-broken-prod cases.
//   3. webhook_events_log has failed-and-unprocessed Polar events
//      (checkWebhookHealth). See its comment block.
//   4. The Pro expiry sweep (expirePro) demoted somebody. Not a
//      failure — a lapse is routine — but money moved, so it rides
//      the same email rather than dying in a log nobody reads.
//      Gated on check 3: while billing is broken the sweep cannot
//      tell a lapsed account from an undelivered renewal, so it
//      stands down rather than risk downgrading a paying customer.
//
// When ANY check trips, sends ONE consolidated alert email to
// ALERT_TO via Resend. De-dup is handled implicitly by the 5-min
// cadence: if the same issue persists, the founder gets one email
// per 5 min until it clears.
//
// Plus one non-alerting job: replay new app_events rows into PostHog
// (see replayAppEvents below). This is the "PostHog-shaped, replay
// later" plan from schema/006_observability.sql — events stay
// first-party in the browser (no third-party tracker, per /privacy);
// PostHog only ever sees them server-side, as a dashboard over data
// we already own. Replay failures log to console, never email — a
// lagging dashboard is not pageable.
//
// And a second daily job that watches the company rather than the product: the
// maintenance sentinel at 03:30 UTC (see sentinel below), which reports the
// machine-checkable duties in docs/control/MAINTENANCE-REGISTER.md and whether
// any maintenance session has stamped a heartbeat in the last two days.
//
// And one job that isn't monitoring at all: a once-a-day scan of Hacker News
// and Reddit for people asking the question this product answers, Telegrammed
// to the founder so he can reply as himself (see scanThreads). It lives here
// because this worker already has a cron, a fetch, and nothing else to do at
// 04:00 UTC — a second worker for five HTTP calls a day would be silly.
//
// Everything this worker says on Telegram is written to telegram_outbox
// (schema/038) as it is said, because a Telegram bot cannot read back its own
// sent history and the record was otherwise only on the founder's phone. See
// sendTelegram below.
//
// Not in scope (deliberately): tracker bundle version, R2 health,
// section_events capture rate. Those are real signals but the bar
// here is "the simplest thing that would have caught the email
// regression before the founder noticed it manually." Payment
// webhooks used to be on that list; 40 days of silently 401-ing
// order webhooks is what took them off it.

// docs/workstreams/seo-and-indexing/KEYWORD-BASIS-2026-08-31.md, grounded in
// real typed searches and real forum phrasings rather than armchair guesses.
//
// Unlike the old stateless scan, this one remembers: radar_items is keyed on
// source_url, so re-seeing a thread is idempotent (its last_seen_at moves, its
// first_seen_at and acted flag do not). That is what lets the digest ask "what
// is new in the last 24 hours" rather than re-sending yesterday's shortlist.

// Each phrase carries the line the founder can open a reply with. Plain, no

// This is the machine-readable half of that document and nothing more.
//
// It is a constant, not a `radar_rules` table, on purpose. A row in a table can
// change what we say in public with no diff, no test, no review and no history,
// and this list is the last thing standing between a drafted reply and a
// permanent ban in somebody else's community. It changes about once a month, in
// a commit, with the document. That is the right amount of friction.
//
// The list is allow-first: a subreddit that is not named here gets no draft and
// never reaches the digest. That is deliberately the safe default, because
// Reddit's search returns every corner of the site and the two Reddit items the
// radar has produced so far were BOTH in places we must never post — a
// competitor's own community (r/papermark) and a promotional dumping ground
// (r/DigitalEscapeTools).
//
// Membership here means only "a disclosed founder comment is permitted at all".
// The per-subreddit conditions that follow from that (comments only, never a
// post; the weekly megathread; karma, age and flair gates) are in the document,
// because the founder does the posting by hand and the code cannot check them.
//
// Seven subreddits that looked obvious came off this list after Sol's review of
// 3 September read their live rules: r/Entrepreneur, r/marketing, r/sales,
// r/freelance and r/webdev forbid the comment outright (r/sales bans a seller
// recommending their own product even when asked, on pain of a permanent ban);
// r/startups requires a linked page to be one the commenter has no affiliation
// with; r/SaaS allows one product mention per sixty days and rejects text that
// reads as machine-written even when a human pasted it. The founder may still
// answer in all seven in his own words with no mention — that is participation,
// and the point is that no machine drafts it for him.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// One-tap posting: a draft, two buttons, the founder's own account.
//
// WHAT IT DOES
//
// A draft that answers a Reddit thread arrives as its own Telegram message
// with two buttons. "Post as me" posts that exact text from HIS Reddit
// account; "Skip" closes it. Replying with different wording replaces the text
// and comes back as a new message with its own buttons. The SOP rule is
// unchanged — only the founder speaks in public — and the tap IS the speaking.
//
// WHAT SOL'S REVIEW CHANGED (3 Sep 2026)
//
// The first cut treated a callback carrying a draft id as proof of a tap. It
// is not. These are the five things that now stand between an HTTP request and
// a comment posted under the founder's name.
//
//   1. WHO. Every update must come from the configured founder user id, in the
//      configured private chat. The webhook secret proves the request came
//      from something holding a shared value; it cannot prove a human tapped.
//      Telegram sends `from.id` and `chat.id` precisely so they can be checked.
//   2. WHICH. An approval is bound to one message id, one immutable version of
//      the text, and one single-use nonce with a 72-hour expiry. A tap on a
//      stale message, an old version, a spent nonce or an expired draft does
//      nothing but say why. This is what makes a leftover button — an edit
//      race, or a keyboard Telegram failed to remove — inert rather than a
//      way to post text that was never approved on that message.
//   3. ONE WAY. `posted` and `skipped` are terminal, enforced by a database
//      trigger, and every transition is conditional. A Skip arriving mid-post
//      can no longer unclaim a draft Reddit is already being asked about.
//   4. THE RESERVATION. An append-only row is written BEFORE the Reddit
//      request leaves, inside the same locked function that counts the daily
//      cap. It is never removed. A request whose answer never arrived leaves
//      the draft in `reconcile`, and nothing is retried until a reconciliation
//      check has looked at the account's own recent comments. The old design
//      released its guard on failure, so a comment Reddit accepted but never
//      acknowledged left the thread open to be commented on twice.
//   5. NOTHING UPSTREAM IS QUOTED. Reddit's response body never reaches a row,
//      a message or a log. A status and an error code map to one of OUR
//      sentences; an unrecognised code is reported as a code, not as text.
//
// The tokens: the refresh token is a Worker secret, exchanged for a
// short-lived access token per post, and no code path here writes any of them
// to a row, a log line, or a message.

/** The cap on comments in a rolling 24 hours. The worker checks it before a tap
 *  is spent, for a friendlier message, and passes the same number to
 *  reserve_radar_post(), which decides it under a lock and is the authority — so
 *  there is one number rather than two that can drift apart.
 *
 *  Two, not the five the function defaults to, because the engagement standard
 *  says at most two comments a day and a written rule the code contradicts is
 *  not a rule. The standard's other two limits, five a week and one per
 *  subreddit per week, are the founder's discipline until a migration can count

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// User feed.
//
// Everything this worker said until now was about the machine: a route down, a
// webhook stuck, a cron that didn't fire. The people were invisible. Somebody
// signing up, sharing for the first time, being read by an outsider, or walking
// into the free limit only ever showed up if the founder went and looked — so
// in practice it showed up late, or not at all, and the first paying customer
// was noticed a day after he paid.
//
// Four moments, one Telegram message each, on the five-minute cron:
//   1. a real sign-up, with where they came from
//   2. a real user's FIRST share — the moment someone stops browsing
//   3. the FIRST outside read of a share — "a link you sent got opened", once
//   4. money moving: an upgrade to Pro, a cancellation, a drop back to free
//   5. money being considered: the free cap refusing a link, the upgrade page
//      being opened — at most once per user per day each
// A custom domain going live is the sixth, and it is said by the domain
// lifecycle (finishPromotion) because that is where the fact is known.
//
// What used to be here and is not any more: every later read of a share. A
// week of the old feed was 25 messages and most were "X's document was read",
// which told the founder nothing he could act on. Later reads are now one
// counted line a day (userFeedDaily), which also carries the day's intent
// totals — the buying signals are the point of the feed, so they are kept and
// rationed rather than dropped.
//
// "Once" is the hard part, and it is not solved in memory. The window is
// [cursor, now) — closed at BOTH ends, read from user_feed_cursor (schema/051),
// written back only after the sends. An open-ended "since the cursor" window
// would re-send anything created between the query and the cursor write, and a
// worker-local "already told him" set would forget on every redeploy. Reads
// happen first and the cursor moves last, so a Supabase refusal mid-run leaves
// the cursor where it was and the next run covers the same window: at-least-
// once, never at-most-once, which for four messages a day is the right way
// round.
//
// Internal accounts are excluded everywhere, and by domain rather than by a
// list of ids, because the founder's own testing is what made "2 connector
// users" wrong once already. The demo share is excluded for the same reason:
// it is linked from the blog, so strangers open it daily and none of it is a

// Custom domains: the state machine that moves a customer's own hostname from
// pending to live, and off again when it stops answering.
//
// The customer does one thing: point a CNAME at customers.htmlradar.page. Two
// separate parties then have to agree before we serve anything on that name —
// Cloudflare (the hostname is active and its certificate is issued) and our own
// worker (the hostname reaches THIS account's content, proved by a content-free
// probe path that answers with the domain's id). Believing only Cloudflare
// would let a name that resolves somewhere else read as live; believing only
// the probe would let us promise HTTPS before the certificate exists.
//
// Two things this file is careful about, both of which cost a customer their
// working links if they are got wrong:
//
//   A failure of OURS is not a failure of THEIRS. When the Cloudflare API is
//   down, or times out, or answers something we cannot parse, we have learnt
//   nothing about the customer's domain. That records a reason and stops. Only
//   a probe that actually answered wrongly, or a successful Cloudflare call
//   saying the hostname or certificate is no longer active, counts towards the
//   two strikes that disconnect a domain.
//
//   Every write names the row it read — its state AND its last_checked_at — so
//   a slow check cannot land on top of a newer one, and a check that started
//   before the customer disconnected cannot resurrect the row. A PATCH that
//   matches nothing means the world moved on, and the run stops there rather
//   than announcing a transition it did not make. A retired row is touched by
//   exactly one thing, the hourly sweep below, and only ever in one field.
